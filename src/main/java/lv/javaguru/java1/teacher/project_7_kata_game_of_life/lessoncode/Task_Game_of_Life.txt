Game of Life kata

Instructions

Implement a finite version of Conway's Game of Life.

Here are the rules (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life):

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite
two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells,
each of which is in one of two possible states: alive or dead.

Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours,
which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically,
or diagonally adjacent to it. At each step in time,
the following transitions occur:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies,
   as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives
   on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies,
   as if by overcrowding.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell,
   as if by reproduction.

The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system.
The first generation is created by applying the above
rules simultaneously to every cell in the seedâ€”births
and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment
at which this happens is sometimes called a tick
(in other words, each generation is a pure function of the preceding one).

Notes

The dimensions of the array stay constant throughout
the game - the 'universe' never grows.

Cells outside the bounds of the array should be considered
permanently dead (they never come to life).


Bonus

Make a beautiful console UI to render grid of any size in one page.

Make sure you have enough coverage of edge
cases - where there are births and deaths at the edge of the grid.
